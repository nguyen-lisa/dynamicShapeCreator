Dynamic Shape Creator Application Description

Implement a web page which consists of a form which accepts a group of radio buttons with the values,
"Random," "Square," and "Circle." After the user clicks the button, the app creates 100 children of whichever value was selected from the radio button. When the mouse moves over a child, the box should be removed from the
div. When the div has one child box, pop up an alert that says, "Last one!".
If the random is selected, the app should pick either "Square" or "Circle" at random and create 100 of those children.
